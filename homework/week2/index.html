<h2>Homework #1 - The Human Computer</h2>
<p>Create a webpage using HTML that contains a list of instructions meant to be executed by a human. Your instructions don't have to be for anything abstract (although I encourage you to be creative) - it can be as simple as "how to make a PB&J sandwich".</p>

<br>

<h2>Requirements</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Your code must at least contain the &lthtml&gt, &lthead&gt, &lttitle&gt, and &ltbody&gt tags.</li>
  <li>Your code must use the &ltol&gt and &ltli&gt tags to create an ordered list of at least 3 steps in your instructions.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Submission</h2>
<p>You will submit your homework by uploading your HTML file to canvas.</p>

<br>

<h2>Things To Think About</h2>
<ul>
  <li>How can you be sure your instructions will be understood as you intended them to be?</li>
  <li>What is the trade off between specificity and expression?</li>
  <li>What is the relationship between the "instructor" and the "performer"?</li>
</ul>
